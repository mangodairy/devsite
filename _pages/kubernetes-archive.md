## Kubernetes in 7 days? In a week !!!


Kubernetes in 7 days( Seven modules, **if you do not have time in your day to day work spent 10 minutes going through this,** so that you will get a basic understanding of Kubernetes in a week time ). The Kubernetes is well documented in [kubernetes.io web site ](https://kubernetes.io/) but it is little difficult for beginners to get through that documentation. I tried my level best to simplify the concept.

So what are you waiting for? 10 minutes in a day is just the time you normally take for going through some post in your favourite whatsup group.

I found time to prepare all this documentation by avoiding chat in a few of my favourite whatsup group. So no doubt you can make it too!
